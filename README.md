Intro repository for github purposes

Hello to those who will ever read this besides myself ;-)

I am trained in C++ but enjoy learning new languages, especially Python and Java.  I have used Github before for research purposes and to obtain source code for other projects but I have decided to have my own Github account for anything I may want to share with you all :-)
